# CharityML
A machine learning model that predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, which helps non-profit organizations that survive on donations to  better understand how large of a donation to request from an individual, or whether or not to reach out to an individual for donation.

### Methodology
* Data preprocessing
* Model training & building prediction pipelines
* Evaluating model performance
* Model tuning based on feature selection
